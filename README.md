# switch-witch

This is a for fun from scratch-ish program I am making to help a streamer friend out. He doesn't know it, but it's basically local image github.  The goal is to have a program that will stage images and text files into a single folder that can be referenced in the streaming software.

This is my first real project so don't judge too harshly
