# switch-witch

This is a for fun from scratch-ish program I am making to help a streamer friend out.  The goal is to have a program that will stage images and text files into a single folder that can be referenced in the streaming software.

This is my first real project so don't judge too harshly

Also, If you download anything from here without knowing what it does I am not responsible for any lost or gained files.
